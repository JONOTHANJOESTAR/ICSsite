				<br><p><em>Classmate Name:</em> Siddarth</p><div class="DivSize"><p><em>Critique/Comments:</em>  Good colour scheme, the footer position needs to be consistent,and the spacing between the title and pictures isn't consistent</p></div>
				
				<br><p><em>Classmate Name:</em> Russell</p><div class="DivSize"><p><em>Critique/Comments:</em>  Your website is simple and easy to follow, with placeholders ready for new content over the semester. The only criticism I have is that as of March,4,2019 your "About Me" page does not have enough detail. On this page, name some work experience, tech skills, education, information that people looking at this website would definitely want to know about you. Maybe include hobbies or favourite subjects so users can talk to about something (Jojo).</p></div>

				<br><p><em>Classmate Name:</em> Osman</p><div class="DivSize"><p><em>Critique/Comments:</em> our website looks nice but you should add more content to your site. Try adding pictures that could go with your site's colour theme and make it look more interesting.</p></div>
				<br><p><em>Classmate Name:</em> NAME GOES HERE</p><div><p><em>Critique/Comments:</em> CRITIQUE GOES HERE</p></div>
