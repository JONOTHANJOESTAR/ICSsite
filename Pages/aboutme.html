			<h2>About me</h2>
	
			<br><div class="DivSize2"><img src="../Images/lego.jpg" style="float: left;"> <P>	Currently I am in the second semester of my grade 11 year. The courses that I have already taken in semester 1 are grade 11 Chemistry, Physics, Biology, & Computer Engineering. I chose these courses since I want to persue electrical engineering as a career option but I also have accounting as a back up career. I enjoyed building and creating new things which is why over the grade 7 summer I took a few lego mindstorm classes since this combined my interst in building and robotics.</P></div>
